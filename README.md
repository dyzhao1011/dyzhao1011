### Hi there, I'm Michael Zhao ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Computer Science major @ CCNY. I am currently unsure what career path I will follow but I would love to get a hands on experience in many fields. <img src= "https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/115419534/220510308-57641314-3379-4d9e-90c4-95ffc0398813.png" width="25">

Currently, I am studying Web Design & Web Development. I am curious and enjoy every process involving the development of a website. I love the aspect of designing a very cool looking user interface that many people would interact with.
