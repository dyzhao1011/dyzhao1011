### Hi there, I'm Da Yuan Zhao ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Computer Science major @ CCNY who is studying data science and machine learning. I discovered that working with data is something that I definitely want to continously do. Part of this fascination spills into machine learning where I can use that data to create something.
